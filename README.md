![Animated demo of vizmo flying through a galaxy simulation](vizmo_demo.gif)

Real-time 3D fly-through explorer for unstructured simulation data. Loads simulation snapshot data and renders interactive surface density maps, mass-weighted averages, velocity dispersions, and composite lightness x color maps on the GPU via WebGPU.

Codes whose outputs have been successfully loaded to date:
- GIZMO
- AREPO
- Gadget-3
- Athena
- RAMSES
- ART

If your data format is parseable by `yt` then vizmo should be able to load it.

This is a **vibecoded** app. I have no idea how its front- or backends work, and am not sure if I could really properly support or get it running for you 10 years from now! But it would not exist otherwise. Software is weird now. It is what it is. 

But I hope you enjoy it and please feel free to report bugs, request features, or develop your own and send a PR. Making it work for more data formats is well within scope, just ask!

## Installation

### pypi

```bash
pip install vizmo
```

### Local source

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.9
- WebGPU-capable GPU (Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux, D3D12 on Windows)

## Quickstart

Run `vizmo` with a snapshot file as the argument:

```bash
vizmo path/to/snapshot.hdf5
```

For gizmo/arepo/gadget: The snapshot must contain at least one `PartTypeN` group with `Coordinates`. Masses come from a per-particle `Masses` dataset or, when absent (TNG-style dark matter), from the header `MassTable`. Smoothing lengths are taken from `SmoothingLength`/`KernelMaxRadius`/`Hsml`/`StellarHsml`/`SubfindHsml` if present, otherwise from a per-type softening in the header (e.g. `SofteningTypeN`, `SofteningTable`), and as a last resort computed on the fly via meshoid — that last-resort result is cached under `~/.cache/vizmo` so it only happens once per snapshot. Star particles (`PartType5`) are rendered as point sources when present.

### Particle type selection

A row of six tickboxes labeled `0`–`5` at the top of the user menu controls which `PartTypeN` groups are loaded into the active particle pool. Disabled (greyed out) ticks correspond to types that are not present in the snapshot. Toggling a tick reloads the pool, refreshes the **Weight**/**Field 2**/**Data** dropdowns to show only the scalar/vector fields that are common to *all* selected types, and re-runs auto-range. The default selection is `PartType0` if present, otherwise the first available type.

### CLI options

```
vizmo snapshot.hdf5 [--width 1920] [--height 1080] [--fov 90]
                    [--fullscreen] [--screenshot OUT.png]
                    [--profile OUT.pstats]
                    [--types 0,1,4] [--center X,Y,Z | --center-on MODE]
                    [--radius R] [--colormap NAME] [--screenshot-dir DIR]
```

- `--types 0,1,4` — initial `PartTypeN` selection (default: gas only).
- `--center X,Y,Z` — aim the starting view at this point (snapshot coords).
- `--center-on {densest,potential,com,median}` — auto-find the starting
  center: highest-density particle, potential minimum, center of mass, or
  mass-weighted median. Falls back to `median` when the needed fields are
  missing.
- `--radius R` — starting camera distance from the center; also rescales
  flight speed to the framed region.
- `--colormap NAME` — starting colormap.
- `--screenshot-dir DIR` — where `P`-key screenshots and `V`-key frame
  recordings go (default: cwd).

Centering on the densest gas of a TNG halo cutout, for example:

```bash
vizmo cutout.hdf5 --center-on densest --radius 300 --colormap inferno
```

## Rendering backend

vizmo uses a WebGPU backend ([wgpu-py](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py)) with GPU-resident particle data. Compute shaders perform frustum culling, LOD selection, and per-cell summary gathering with zero CPU↔GPU per-frame transfer. On unified-memory systems (Apple Silicon) field switches are also near-zero copy.

The renderer uses progressive refinement and an auto-LOD subsample cap that adapts within a user-controlled ceiling to keep interaction smooth during motion and sharpen on idle.

## Algorithms

Getting this to work on 100M+ particle datasets has been tricky. Here is what has worked so far:
- Adaptive random subsampling, rescaling masses and radii appropriately, wired up to a PID loop to achieve a smooth framerate.
- Fully-sampled renders when the camera stops, resuming adaptive subsampling when it moves again.
- Multi-grid kernel splatting, implementing the algorithm of [meshoid](https://github.com/mikegrudic/meshoid) on the GPU, so that particles appearing large on the screen do not have to splat a huge number of pixels.
- GPU-side brute-force frustum culling. Experimented extensively with tree-based algorithms, but at ~100M bruteforce works fine.

## Controls

Press `F1` or `H` in-app for this list. The top-left toolbar gives
one-click Auto-range / Screenshot / Rec / Help.

**Camera:**
- `W/A/S/D` — Move forward/left/back/right
- `Z/X` — Move up/down
- `Q/E` — Roll left/right
- Mouse (click + drag) — Look around
- Scroll wheel — Adjust flight speed
- `Ctrl`+Scroll or `[/]` — Optical zoom (FOV 10–140°)
- `1-9` — Jump to camera bookmark; `Shift+1-9` — save bookmark
  (persisted per snapshot under `~/.config/vizmo`)

**Visualization:**
- `Tab` — Hide/show all UI
- `C` — Cycle colormap
- `L` — Toggle log/linear scale
- `R` — Auto-range color scale (composite: Color slot)
- `T` — Auto-range composite Lightness slot
- `+/-` — Contract/expand color range
- `,/.` — Lower/raise the auto-LOD subsample-cap ceiling
- `P` — Save screenshot
- `V` — Start/stop frame recording (PNG sequence + ffmpeg hint)
- `F1` or `H` — Help panel
- `\` — Toggle dev overlay
- `K` — Toggle sink/star panel
- `Esc` — Close help, then quit

Colormap, mouse inversion, and target FPS persist across sessions in
`~/.config/vizmo/config.json`.

## Render Modes

Select from the **Mode** dropdown in the user menu:

- **SurfaceDensity** — Projected surface density of a weight field. Supports combining two fields with arithmetic operators (Op / Field 2).
- **WeightedAverage** — Mass-weighted line-of-sight average of a data field.
- **WeightedVariance** — Mass-weighted line-of-sight standard deviation (e.g. velocity dispersion).
- **Composite** — CoolMap-style dual-field visualization. Encodes one field in lightness and another in colormap hue. Each channel has independent render mode, field selection, limits, and scaling.

### Vector Fields

3D vector fields (e.g. Velocities) are automatically detected. When selected as a weight or data field, a **Proj** dropdown appears:

- **LOS** — Per-particle line-of-sight component (dot product with the unit vector from the camera to the particle). Invariant under camera rotation; recomputed when the camera translates past a small threshold.
- **|v|** — Euclidean norm.
- **|v|^2** — Squared norm.
